- 👋 Hi, I’m @jessjalbs
- 👀 I’m interested in finding a junior data analyst position after recently leaving my career in education. 
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my understanding of spreadsheets, SQL, R, and various data visualization software programs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project to help me build up my portfolio! 
- 📫 Find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessjalbs/
- 👩🏼‍💻 More about me: My hobbies include reading (excessively), crafting (I am an old 28), learning French (shout out Duolingo), and cooking (not cleaning, unless it's data).
